# EulerClassTightBinding
Implementation in Wolfram Mathematica of an algorithm 
that generates real symmetric tight-binding models (3-band and 4-band) 
for fixed arbitrary Euler class based on the Pl√ºcker embedding. 
This is a companion to the theoretical work 
"Geometric approach to fragile topology beyond symmetry indicators", arxiv:2005.02044.
